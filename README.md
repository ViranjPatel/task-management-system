## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment

## Important Notes

1. **First-time GitHub Pages deployment** might take 5-10 minutes to become available.
2. **Render Backend Sleep**: The backend on Render's free tier goes to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. First request will be slow (10-20 seconds) while it wakes up.
3. **Database Persistence**: SQLite database on Render resets on each deployment or maintenance.
